# OWASP Top 10 Security Guidelines

## Code Security Requirements

Ensure all code implementations are protected against the **OWASP Top 10** vulnerabilities:

### Core Vulnerabilities to Address

- **Broken Access Control** - Implement proper authorization checks
- **Cryptographic Failures** - Use strong encryption and secure data transmission
- **Injection** - Sanitize all user inputs and use parameterized queries
- **Insecure Design** - Follow secure design principles and threat modeling
- **Security Misconfiguration** - Maintain secure default configurations
- **Vulnerable and Outdated Components** - Keep dependencies updated and monitored
- **Identification and Authentication Failures** - Implement robust authentication mechanisms
- **Software and Data Integrity Failures** - Verify software integrity and secure CI/CD pipelines
- **Security Logging and Monitoring Failures** - Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring
- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)** - Validate and restrict server-side requests

### Implementation Standards

- Validate all inputs at application boundaries
- Apply security controls consistently across the codebase
- Regular security testing and code reviews required
- Document security decisions and assumptions
